**To Do**-like software merely does simple jobs. We create tasks, receive alerts, and mark them complete. But crafting an interactive user interface and user experience is a different story. It could not be done without lots of careful thoughts. When it comes to the animation, it becomes much harder than before where all the elements move instantly without exposing any state changes. This project aims to create an elaborate UI and UX without compromising the features that essentially required by the guidelines.
